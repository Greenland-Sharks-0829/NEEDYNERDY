All books mentioned below are downloadable at https://zh.z-lib.org/

##### Math Prep
>[!notes] Textbook for quick reference, not for systematic reading
> *if a quick brief on calculus is needed, search on these websites*:
 https://steadyhq.com/en/brightsideofmaths/about; 
 https://brilliant.org/home/#; 
 https://ocw.mit.edu/.
> *Linear Algebra (useful in general for all courses that has an empirical focus)*: https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/
> *Advanced probability theory*:
*i)* Brzezniak, Z. and Zastawniak, T., 2000. Basic stochastic processes: a course through exercises. Springer Science & Business Media; ==very basic, start from this one==.
*ii)* Walsh, J.B., 2012. Knowing the odds: an introduction to probability (Vol. 139). American Mathematical Soc.; ==focus on martingales chapter, useful for finance in general==.
> *Real analysis*: Bartle, R.G. and Sherbert, D.R., 2000. Introduction to real analysis (Vol. 2). New York: Wiley.; ==Comes with a solution manual, pick some for practice==.
> *Introductory Functional analysis (will be sufficient presumably, unlikely is going to get this far)*: Christensen, O., 2010. Functions, spaces, and expansions: mathematical tools in physics and engineering_. Springer Science & Business Media.; *also check the online courses*: https://cosmolearning.org/video-lectures/normed-vector-spaces-i/
> *anything that belongs to **'I-don't-know-what-the-heck-this-is-dear-god-so-much-new-math'** category, check:* An Introduction to Mathematical Analysis for Economic Theory and Econometrics, Dean Corbae


##### Microeconomics

>[!notes] Textbook Chapters (Graduate Level)
>Advanced Microeconomic Theory, 3rd Edition, Geoffrey A. Jehle, Philip J. Reny, ==Chapter 1, 3, 4, 5==
>*Got extra time*: Microeconomic theory, Andreu Mas-Colell, Michael D. Whinston, Jerry R. Green, ==Chapter 1-3, Chapter 5-6, Chapter 10-11, Chapter 15-16==.
>*backup undergraduate level reference*: Intermediate Microeconomics with Calculus, Varian.



##### Macroeconomics
>[!notes] Textbook Chapters (Graduate Level)
> *If New Keynesian Framework (most likely)*: Macroeconomic Fluctuations and Policies, Challe, E., 2019, ==Chapter 2,3,4,6,7==.
> *For Dynamic Optimisation Counterpart*: 
*i)* Elements of Dynamic Optimisation, Alpha C. Chiang. ==Really just a math book without the context of macro, though I believe you can use it just for the method, plus it's the simplest and clearest you could find on this topic.==
*ii)* Recursive methods in dynamic economics, Lucas & Stokey, 1989, ==Chapter 1-6==; Key concepts: a) Theorem of Maximum; b) Principle of Optimality (these two can be found in Lucas & Stokey textbook,  came with the solution manual, try the questions in the book). ==plus in this book macro context really comes into play==.
> *backup undergraduate level reference*: Advanced Macroeconomics, Romer, 4th or 5th edition.
> *If things get too 'empirical'*: 
*i)* The ABCs of RBCs: An Introduction to Dynamic Macroeconomic Models, McCandless. ==very nice review on the theory, plus it comes with codes in the back==
(unlike the Challe E. book, this has a tendency over neoclassical approach, I list this in case your lecturer suddenly decided that you don't really need a lucid understanding on DGSE, so now you have both in preparation).
*ii)* *god prevents it does not let you master dynare on your own*: https://callumjones.github.io/files/dynare_man.pdf, a practical guide to Dynare Plugins of **Matlab**. **Dynare** is old, though still in major play: used by most of the central banks and most of the macroeconomists. It's helpful to have it in the toolkit, for job positions such as macro analyst or economist at FRED, OECD, etc. 
> *an abstract bible, save it for use, not really designed for master-level course, but good for searching unfamilar concepts in macro or empiricalproject (such as your master thesis) ideas, provided you have a solid foundation and a great interest in macro research*: Recursive Methods in Macroeconomics, Sargent.
> *in case the course let you use Python*: https://quantecon.org/


##### Asset Pricing
>[!notes] Textbook Chapters
> Dynamic Macroeconomic Theory, Sargent, ==Chapter 1 and 3==.
> Singleton, K.J., 2009. Empirical dynamic asset pricing: model specification and econometric assessment. Princeton University Press., ==don't have to read, just have it as a reference in case you need it for project ideas.==.

>[!hint] Piece of advice for Micro, Macro and Asset Pricing
> *i)* If the lecture notes are shitty and lectuers are just mumbling through the course, *self-study* may be more effective in getting great scores. Find the relevant concepts in lecture notes from the above textbooks, but *don't get lost and go too far.*
> *ii)* If Micro lecturer is in general giving  'useful' lectures, listen to him or her very carefully. Macro can be done mostly by self-study, but Micro to my perspective needs a good lead.
> *iii)* Asset pricing has a nice intersection with Macro, deliver your best effort in Macro, as it may be a *one stone two birds* situation. If schedule is tight, you can just skip the previews of asset pricing.

##### Econometrics
>[!notes] Some Programming References:
>*if it's standard graduate level ecoometrics, use*:  Econometrics, Hansen, ==just for quick reference, a bit hard to swallow but it's the best of all==.
> *For R programming*: https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/index.html
> *For Time Series theoreticals*: 
*i)* suggest to find some lecture notes to brief, focus on multivariate time series, pay attention to asymptotic properties, not likely the course will be "very theoretical". For examples of lecture notes, check: https://people.stat.sc.edu/wang528/Stat%20720/STAT720%20Notes.pdf.
*ii)* "bible": Time Series Analysis, Hamilton, ==also just for quick reference, old but still good==.
> *For Time Series Empiricals*: The use of Eviews and R programming will be essential. 
> *For Eviews' usage in Time Series*: Time Series Data Analysis Using EViews,  I. Gusti Ngurah Agung, ==quick reference==, by the syllbus, also good for Empirical Finance.
> *For general stats background quick reference*:  All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, Larry A. Wasserman; three links from **Math Prep** section are also good.


>[!hint] Piece of advice
>- Most likely the focus will be on **time series analysis**, if not (the case wthere it is a standard graduate level econometrics, find some lecture notes, check: http://econphd.econwiki.com/notes.htm, some of the links are not available anymore, but these are the examples you can choose from); even if it's not the focus of Econometrics, it will be the focus of **Empirical Finance**.
>- **GITHUB & Stackoverflow IS YOUR FRIEND!!!**, -- search for examples before you start writing any lines of codes.
>- **Don't** get start too soon for previews of Econometrics, unlike macro or micro, each run may be significantly different from each other, plus the content heavily relies on the lectuer's taste.
>- For the above reason, if the course is mostly theoretical, rely on the lecture notes of the course; if the course is mostly empirical (i.e., with heavy and frequent projects), then find a great teammate.. :)


##### Empirical Finance
>[!summary] Textbook Chapters
> Analysis of Financial Time Series, Third Edition (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics) Ruey S. Tsay, ==Chapter 1 and 3==.
> The Econometrics of Financial Markets, John Y. Campbell, Andrew W. Lo, A. Craig MacKinlay,  ==Chapter 1,-3, 5==, just a glance will do.
> Financial Econometrics: Problems, Models, and Methods, Christian Gourieroux and Joann Jasiak; ==Chapter 6==, for volatility models.
> Asset Price Dynamics, Volatility, and Prediction, Stephen J. Taylor, ==Chapter 8-11, also for volatility models, use it if the previous one is too advanced.==
